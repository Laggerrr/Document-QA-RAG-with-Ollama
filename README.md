Hi, this a pretty simple example of local RAG done with Ollama models. You can use it as a head-up.
This code was made to solve the test task.
First, you need to download Ollama and use ```ollama pull``` command in your terminal to download mistral and nomic-embed-text
(you can see the list of models at https://ollama.com/).
Check if they are downloaded using ```ollama list```.
After that just use ```pip install -r requirements.txt```, and you should be good.
